This app detects faces in images.

### Design Goals
The goal of making this app is to incorporate a back-end server & database into a webapp. The app should have a login function and store users on the server. The app uses the Clarifai API 'face detection model' (https://docs.clarifai.com) to detect faces in images provided by the user.
